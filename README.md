Learning to use Github ;D


Well, today is the day, where my real IT career starts! 
Save the date: 31/07/2020

It's truly going to be a succesful career! (I hope at least ;) )
Well, it's time to go and continue to learn about GitHub, with the goal of course to learn the great programming language Python!

Good Luck to myself, and if you ever come back to see this, we're in unsafe times in the Dordogne haha

No, jk, we're fine and easily surviving the corona virus, which is gaining in power againg :(

One last word: "Courez, Pauvre Fou!", Gandalf Le Gris.
